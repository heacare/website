_Reactive healthcare is approaching its limits._

Advances in technology and public health have boosted life expectancies for people in countries around the world. But as we face an aging population, the reality that boosting lifespan with no regards to healthspan just increases human suffering becomes obvious.

The costs of traditional healthcare are unsustainble and the benefits are inequitably distributed to the privileged few. With all this, health data continues to be fragmented between governments and corporations. Preventative healthcare, is known to be more efficient for human longevity but is a hard problem to solve due to the challenges of population behavioural change and inaccessibility to health data.

Web 3 enables incentive mechnisms that create the kind of mass behaviour change and co-ordination that preventative healthcare needs. Web 3 technology stacks honor privacy and allow individuals to own and permission their health data for the benefit of all.

{{< emphasis >}}We deserve accessible preventative healthcare as a public good.{{< /emphasis >}}
